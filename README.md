GitHub Dashboard Application

Introduction
GitHub Dashboard is a web application that allows users to visualize their GitHub profile data in an interactive and user-friendly way. This project was developed to help GitHub users better understand their contributions, top languages, and recent activities.

Team Members:

Mwangilwa ZImba: Fullstack Developer

Purpose: This application was created for developers who want to get insights into their GitHub profile data without navigating through multiple pages on GitHub.

Personal Focus: My personal focus was on integrating the GitHub OAuth, handling API requests, and visualizing data using Chart.js.
